//Q.  What is the difference between  urinary , binary ,  ternary operator ?
/*
Operators are based on operands
1. urinary operator => single operand
2. binary operator  => two operand 
3. ternary operator => three operand

 */

// 1. urinary
let a = 5;

// urinary operator
//single operand
let b = -a;
console.log(b);
//output : -5

console.log(++a);
//ouput: 6

//binary operator
let x = 10;
let y = 3;

//Binary operator
//Two operand

let z = x + y; //  two operand
console.log(z);
//ouput: 13

// Ternary operator
//Three operand

// let result = condition ? "yes" : "no";
// console.log(result);

let result1 = 2 === 2 ? "yes" : "no";
console.log(result1);
